# A-Comparative-Study-of-Deep-Learning-Models-with-Explainable-AI-for-Chest-X-ray-Images
•   Conducted a comparative study of deep learning models (Inceptionv4, Resnet50, Vision Transformer) to classify chest X-ray images using 
     NIH-CXR-LT and MIMIC-CXR-LT medical datasets
•   Demonstrated the superiority of Vision Transformer over traditional CNNs with an impressive AUC of 0.9932, utilizing explainable AI such 
     as GradCAM, SHAP to showcase the interpretability of models for improved clinical interpretability and diagnostic accuracy
